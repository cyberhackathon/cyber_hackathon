                                    “Every Contact by a criminal leaves behind a trace” -Edmond Locard<br>
                                    As cybercrime continues to grow exponentially, cybercriminals are innovating with the advancement of technology. At the same time, Uttarakhand Police remains committed to arrest such criminals and mitigate crime. With the same zeal, we present the first-ever Cyber Hackathon in the state of Uttarakhand. UPES supports Devbhoomi Cyber Hackathon being organised by the Uttarakhand Police.

With the increasing reliance on technology, cybersecurity has become an even bigger concern. From zoom class raids to scam mails, all of us have experienced what it feels to be vulnerable to these faceless criminals who exploit the gaps in cybersecurity. Hence we are providing you with the platform to showcase your big idea to change the “CyberSpace”. A platform to let the hidden stars of tomorrow shine. A place to connect, grow and innovate with like-minded individuals. A place to forge bonds and code over coffee and ideas.

So come, join us at DEVBHOOMI CYBER HACKATHON and take up the challenge to outdo, outthink and outcode your biggest opponent, you yourself.

                                   Established in the year 2003 through the UPES Act of the State Legislature of Uttarakhand, UPES has been accredited Grade ‘A’ by NAAC through the sheer perseverance of students and faculties alike.

Nestled in the scenic environs of the Dehradun, UPES is a University with a purpose, a purpose of guiding the youth of the nation to a new horizon of opportunities. Similar to the Shivaliks being the base of the Himalayas, UPES has been providing foundation to the students who become the pillars of tomorrow. 

Under the vision of ‘Learning through Sharing’ UPES runs an International Connect program in which we provide joint research, international internships and student-faculty exchange opportunities with our partners; the universities of Queensland, Berkely and Adelaide among others. This provides a unique and unparalled learning experience, a global exposure which reflects in our placement record of 100% in School of Computer Science.

A campus full of life and energy, UPES Dehradun has been contributing to the nation building effort by helping students find their purpose and become the guiding stars of a better future.
